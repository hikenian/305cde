Owning a Pet
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
There are several ways to acquire a pet. You could, for instance, buy from a licensed trader or adopt from an approved non-profit making voluntary animal welfare organisation.

Importing Pet
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
If you need to import a pet from overseas, you should apply for a special permit from the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). Requirements differ according to the type of animal and the country of origin.

<p style="font-size:22px;">
Dog Licensing
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
It is a legal requirement to obtain a licence for keeping a dog aged five months or over. You may wish to apply for the licence at the time your dog is vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. This can be done at any of the licensing centres of AFCD, privately-run registered veterinary clinics or the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). A dog keeper must notify the AFCD of change in ownership or his/her address within 5 days of the change

Keeping Pet in Subsidised Public Housing
</p>
<p style="font-size:14px;">
If you live in one of the public housing estates, you can only keep small household pets that pose no environmental hygienic problems. Otherwise, points will be allotted under the existing Marking Scheme for Estate Management Enforcement in Public Housing Estates. On the other hand, for tenants with genuine need for keeping service dogs under special circumstances, such as keeping of guide dogs for tenants with visual and audio disabilities or keeping of dog for tenants in need of accompany of a dog for mental support as substantiated by medical practitioners, special permission would be granted on discretion by the Housing Authority.

- Groom your pet regularly<br>
